# GoPro HTTP API specification in OpenAPI Format

This used to be a community translation of the GoPro HTTP API in OpenAPI format. Since GoPro Inc. now provides the HTTP API as OpenAPI, this effort is no longer needed.

Please use the [official HTTP Spec from GoPro](https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/http) provided by GoPro Inc.
